# Start-Up
This is the original repository I created when first acquainting myself with GitHub
This original readme edit is another step in familiarizing myself with how GitHub works.

This is an addition that I have returned to make MUCH later than my original entry.  Trying to continue getting aquanted with Github after a very long hiatis from it.
